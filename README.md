  <h2>:book: Description</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>:busts_in_silhouette: An application that implements a simple database system, allowing for the management of employees</li>
    <li>:clipboard: Uses a graphical user interface made via NetBeans GUI builder to organize different information</li>
    <li>:books: Programmed as the cumulative final project for high school advanced computer science class</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>:file_folder: Contents</h2>
  <p>There are a lot of files within the project that can be ignored. Looking at the core files within the <strong>src/main/java</strong> folder:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>FTE.java</strong> is a class representing full-time employees and their respective attributes</li>
    <li><strong>AddFTEJFrame</strong> files are responsible for the page which appears when adding full-time employees</li>
    <li><strong>PTE.java</strong> is a class representing part-time employees and their respective attributes</li>
    <li><strong>AddPTEJFrame</strong> files are responsible for the page which appears when adding part-time employees</li>
    <li><strong>EmployeeInfo.java</strong> contains properties and attributes that are common to all employees</li>
    <li><strong>MainJFrame</strong> files create the main menu and connect the pages seamlessly with each other</li>
    <li><strong>MyHashTable.java</strong> stores all the entered information into a hashtable to act as a database</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>:arrow_down: Installation</h2>
  <p>
    To use the program, it is best to use the NetBeans IDE for optimal results. Simply opening or copy and pasting the core files from the
    <strong>src/main/java</strong> folder should be sufficient in running the application. Launch the <strong>MainJFrame.java</strong> file
    as the driver class, and the rest should work accordingly.
  </p>
  
  <h2>:warning: Disclaimers</h2>
  <p>
    It may be that some components are outdated as this project is quite only and was created on an older version of the NetBeans GUI builder.
    Along with that, this project was done with a hard deadline in mind and so, most of the code structure is unorganized with very little
    comments explaining the code. This is due to the fact that the only deliverable was that the system worked overall. Thus, taking into
    account the deadline, the cleanliness of code was the last priority amongst my partner and I.
